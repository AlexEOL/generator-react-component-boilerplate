## How to develop your component

### Source

Your component source code is in src. You can use JSX and ES6 syntax freely in your component source; it will be transpiled to lib with Babel before being published to npm so that your users will simply be able to include it.

It's a great idea to add a description, documentation and other information to your README.md file, to help people who are interested in using your component.

### Example & Preview

Preview your component with LiveReload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

A webserver will be started on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

You can use this playpen to test your component, and then publish it as live examples to GitHub Pages, which is a great way to let potential users try out your component and see what it can do.

### Build and Publish

```bash
npm run build
```

```bash
npm publish
```
